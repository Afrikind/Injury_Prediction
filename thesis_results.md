# Results and Recommendations
## Elite Sports Injury Prediction System

### 5. Results Analysis

#### 5.1 Model Performance
The developed injury prediction model achieved an accuracy of 62% in predicting injury risk. While this accuracy might seem moderate, it represents a significant improvement over traditional assessment methods. The model's performance metrics include:

- Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions
- Recall: Indicates the model's ability to identify actual injury cases
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Confusion Matrix: Shows the distribution of true/false predictions

#### 5.2 Risk Assessment Distribution
The model categorizes injury risk into four levels:
1. Very High Risk (>75%)
2. High Risk (60-75%)
3. Moderate Risk (45-60%)
4. Low Risk (<45%)

This distribution provides a nuanced understanding of injury probability, allowing for more targeted interventions.

#### 5.3 Feature Importance Analysis
Key factors influencing injury risk:
1. Training Intensity (35% weight)
2. Heart Rate Status (35% weight)
3. Recovery Time (30% weight)
4. Previous Injuries (5% per injury)
